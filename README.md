Scheduling a meeting is a really time-consuming task. We are planning to make this process easier by developing a chatbot with a special scheduling algorithm which is based on participants calendar information that we will access by authenticating users calendars. This will allow users to focus on their tasks rather than having to deal with looping mail traffic while attempting to arrange meetings. Due to its ability to integrate with tools that are commonly used in the industry, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, we decided to develop a chatbot.

Discord bots are AI-driven tools that can help the user to automate tasks on your Discord server. They make it a lot easier to build a community that is truly engaged and can be used to moderate your server.

Our team CodeBrews have created a Discord bot “Pluto bot” using JavaScript with the assistance of the tool Replit. We have taken the support of MongoDb database to store our datasets of dates.
